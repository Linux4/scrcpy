_Description: Manage scrcpy server downloads automatically?
 scrcpy cannot work without a copy of the /usr/share/scrcpy/scrcpy-server
 binary, which needs to be fetched from upstream.
 .
 Please specify whether you want this to be done automatically every time scrcpy
 itself is upgraded.
 .
 If you accept this option, the server binary will be downloaded now, and during
 every upgrade of scrcpy. This will fail if wget / curl, and ca-certificates are
 not available.
 .
 If you reject this option, you will need to fetch the server binary manually,
 for instance by using "sudo /usr/libexec/scrcpy-update-server" yourself. While
 scrcpy might work with a mismatching server, this can cause hard-to-debug
 problems.
 .
 You can change your choice later with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure scrcpy".
